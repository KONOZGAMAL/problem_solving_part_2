        Task
        Given three integers a ,b ,c, return the largest number obtained after inserting the following operators and
        brackets: +, *, ()
        In other words , try every combination of a,b,c with [*+()] , and return the Maximum Obtained (Read the notes
        for more detail about it)
        Example
        With the numbers are 1, 2 and 3 , here are some ways of placing signs and brackets:

        1 * (2 + 3) = 5
        1 * 2 * 3 = 6
        1 + 2 * 3 = 7
        (1 + 2) * 3 = 9
        So the maximum value that you can obtain is 9.

        Notes
        The numbers are always positive.
        The numbers are in the range (1  ≤  a, b, c  ≤  10).
        You can use the same operation more than once.
        It's not necessary to place all the signs and brackets.
        Repetition in numbers may occur .
        You cannot swap the operands. For instance, in the given example you cannot get expression (1 + 3) * 2 = 8.
        Input >> Output Examples:
        expressionsMatter(1,2,3) ==> return 9
        Explanation:
        After placing signs and brackets, the Maximum value obtained from the expression (1+2) * 3 = 9.
