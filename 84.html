<body>
    <p>
        This kata is from check py.checkio.org

        You are given an array with positive numbers and a non-negative number N. You should find the N-th power of the
        element in the array with the index N. If N is outside of the array, then return -1. Don't forget that the first
        element has the index 0.

        Let's look at a few examples:

        array = [1, 2, 3, 4] and N = 2, then the result is 3^2 == 9;
        array = [1, 2, 3] and N = 3, but N is outside of the array, so the result is -1.
    </p>
    <script>
        function index(array, n) {
            return array.length - 1 < n ? -1 : Math.pow(array[n], n);
        }
        console.log(index([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], n));
    </script>
