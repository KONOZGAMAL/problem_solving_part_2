    <p>
        What if we need the length of the words separated by a
        space to be added at the end of that same word and have it returned as an array?
    </p>
    <script>
        function addLength(str) {
            return str.split(" ").map((e) => e + " " + e.length)
        }
        console.log(addLength("you will win"));
        console.log(addLength("apple ban"));
    </script>
</body>
