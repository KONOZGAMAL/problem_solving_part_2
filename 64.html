    <title> L1 Set Alarm</title>
</head>

<body>
    <p>
        Write a function named setAlarm which receives two parameters. The first parameter,
        employed, is true whenever you are employed and the second parameter, vacation is true whenever you are on
        vacation.

        The function should return true if you are employed and not on vacation (because these are the circumstances
        under which you need to set an alarm).
        It should return false otherwise. Examples:
    </p>
    <script>
        function setAlarm(employed, vacation) {
            if (employed==true) {
                     return true
            }
            return false
        }
        console.log(setAlarm(true, false));
    </script>
</body>
