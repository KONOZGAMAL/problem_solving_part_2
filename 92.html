        A square of squares
        You like building blocks.
        You especially like building blocks that are squares.
        And what you even like more,
        is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

        However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those
        blasted things! If you just had a way to know,
        whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building
        blocks is a perfect square.

        console.log(isSquare(-1));//false
