    <title>How many lightsabers do you own</title>
</head>

<body>
    <p>Inspired by the development team at Vooza, write the function that

        accepts the name of a programmer, and
        returns the number of lightsabers owned by that person.
        The only person who owns lightsabers is Zach, by the way.
        He owns 18, which is an awesome number of lightsabers. Anyone else owns 0.</p>
    <script>
        function howManyLightsabersDoYouOwn(name) {
            return name == 'Zach' ? 18 : 0
        }
        console.log(howManyLightsabersDoYouOwn("Zach"));
        console.log(howManyLightsabersDoYouOwn("Amire"));
    </script>
